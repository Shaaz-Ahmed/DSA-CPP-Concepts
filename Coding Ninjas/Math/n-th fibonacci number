Problem statement
You are given an integer ‘N’, your task is to find and return the N’th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 10^9 +7.

Fibonacci number is calculated using the following formula:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), 
Where, F(1) = F(2) = 1.
For Example:
For ‘N’ = 5, the output will be 5.

Sample Input 1:
2
10
7
Sample Output 1:
55
13
Explanation For Sample Output 1:
For the first test case, the 10th Fibonacci number is 55.
For the second test case, the 7th Fibonacci number is 13.

Solution:


#include <bits/stdc++.h>

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int fibonacciNumber(int n){

// Write your code here.

if(n==0 || n==1){

return n;

}

else{

int prev1=0;

int prev2=1;

int current=0;

for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {

current = (prev1 + prev2)%MOD;

prev1 = prev2;  // Update prev1 to F(n-1)

prev2 = current;   // Update prev2 to F(n)

}

return current;

}

}
