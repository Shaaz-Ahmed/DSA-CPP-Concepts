// OOP : stands for Object oriented programming.
// Procedural programming language is about writing the procedure and function and perform a task but in oops it having both object and function
// OOP is much faster than procedural programming.
// Class and object are two main aspect of object-oriented programming language.
// class is a template for object and object is a instance of a class.
// When the individual object is created then it inheriting all the function from class.


// example of class and object.
// class is fruits.
// object apple , banana , mango.

// In c++ everything is object lets understand with real life example
// A car is a object and it has different attribute & methods.
// Attribute is like variable of that object. (weight and color)
// Methods are like function of that object. like what functionality it can do ( drive and brake )
